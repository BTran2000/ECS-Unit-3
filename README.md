# ECS Unit 3

You made it this far, congratulations!

Things to do:

1. If you haven't done it already follow me. You do this by clicking on my name in the upper left hand corner of the page – that will take you to my main page on GitHub and there will be a green follow button there.
2. Work through the [Hello World guide](http://guides.github.com), this will give you an overview of the process of working with GitHub. The big things to understand are:
  * Details and accuracy _really_ matter, practice following directions __exactly__ as they are written.
  * Repositories and how to create them.
  * How to add files to a repository.
  * How to edit files and save your changes.
3. Set up your website starting with [these instructions](http://pages.github.com). Once you get to the part where they want to know what system you are on you're kind of stuck – they don't provide instructions for creating the page online. So pick up with the instructions below.
4. If you haven't verified your e-mail address, you will need to do this. Thanks to @JustinTheMeh for pointing this out. Your site will not be visible until you have a verified e-mail address.
 
## Editing your site using the online editor at GitHub

After creating the repository:

1. Add a file named _index.html_.
2. Click on the pencil icon on the right hand side to enable editing the file.
3. Start simple and test the site - just "Hello, world!" will do it.
4. Commit your changes.
5. Go visit your site!

Note that the first time you commit a change is when the site is actually created and that can take a long time. After the first change updates are almost instant.
