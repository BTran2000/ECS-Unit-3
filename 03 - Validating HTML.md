Validating HTML
===============

Just because browsers are relatively forgiving of _malformed_ HTML doesn't mean that you should write bad code...

Fortunately there are tools to help us find mistakes in our HTML. We call them **HTML Validators**. There are many of them, most work by allowing you to either paste in HTML code or a URL which is then validated.

Here is a list of reasonably good validators. These will all tell you about the problems in your code. But you may find that some of them produce more useful messages. Try out several (also search for HTML validators and see if you find ones that you like better). Here is one to start with:

* [The W3C Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org)

If you find others that you think are better, create an issue or a pull request.
